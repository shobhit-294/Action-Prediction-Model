# INTRODUCTION
HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION
Human activity recognition, or HAR, is a time series classification task in which 
smartphones' sequenced data is classified into known well-defined movements. There 
are two traditional approaches for the time series-based data on fixed-sized windows 
and training machine learning models, such as for ensembles of decision trees.
In this experiment, we will learn about the problem of recognizing human activity and 
the recurrent neural network and deep learning neural network models that are 
achieving state-of-the-art performance on it. The HAR project aims to analyze human 
behavior in a challenging search-and-retrieve scenario through artificial intelligence 
technology; the notion is that given a system specification; the user can synthesize a 
system that fulfills his requirements by following the process and using the tools 
provided to support it.

# LITERATURE REVIEW
Many researchers have studied human activity recognition, and each has proposed a 
different solution to tackle the associated problems. The primary goal of this work was 
to fill a gap in the literature regarding how humans might perform in a complex search 
and retrieve environment and regarding how the presence of feedback influences 
human performance in such activities. While previous studies have looked at various 
psychological and neurological factors that impact human performance in similar tasks 
requiring lower cognitive work, not much is known about the literature addressed in
this experiment.
To recognize the activity or to accomplish the HAR task, the type and quantity of the 
target and distractors were increased in the test phase, and the performance of the 
human participants improved steadily. This demonstrates the ability of the human brain 
to be able to generalize between training and testing. Over time the performance of 
human participants improved for both the training and test phase (the total scores 
increased); this boost in human performance is most likely due to participants' growing 
acquaintance with their surroundings. After getting the dataset, another essential part is 
data preprocessing. As the quality of input impacts the desired result, quality data needs 
to be collected to get better accuracy.
Various machine learning problems that are time-consuming and labor- expensive are 
being solved by active learning techniques. Some applications shown in Fig. 1.3.1 
include speech recognition, information extraction or handwriting recognition, etc. 
# Advantages of HAR:
a. It gives fast and real-time predictions of problems

b. Efficiently utilizes the resources

c. Helps in the automation of different tasks

d. It is used in business, medicine, sports, etc.

e. It helps to interpret the previous behavior of the model.

# Applications of HAR:
a. Surveillance: Cameras are installed in areas that may need monitoring, such as 
banks, airports, military installations, and convenience stores. Currently, 
surveillance systems are mainly for recording. The Aim of activity detection 
using CCTVâ€Ÿs is to monitor suspicious activities for real-time reactions like 
fighting and stealing.

b. Sports play analysis: analyzing the play and deducing the actions in the sport. 

c. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): Automated understanding of aerial 
images. Recognition of military activities like border security, people in 
bunkers etc. 

d. Monitor Health: Analyze a person's activity from the information collected by 
different devices.

e. Discover activity partners: Discover which are the variables that determine
which activity is doing a person.

f. Detect activity: Calculate a predictive model that can recognize a person's 
activity from the signals received by the sensors.

g. Improve wellbeing: Design individualized exercise tables to improve the 
health of a person.
